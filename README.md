# Machine Learning Specialization
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments (labs and quizzes) of the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) offered by [Standford University](https://www.coursera.org/stanford) and [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/deeplearning-ai) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) thaught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng).

## Certificate

In progress.

## Disclaimer
I highly recommend to all the course participants to immerse yourselves in the course materials by watching all lecture videos, completing quizzes, and tackling code assignments independently before using the solved assignments from this repository. While the programming assignments in this repository can serve as helpful resources and aids in overcoming challenges, avoid the temptation to merely copy and paste code.

## Overview
The Specialization offers a comprehensive learning path to:
* Build ML models with NumPy and scikit-learn.
* Build and train supervised models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear and logistic regression.
* Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.
* Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods.
* Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning, including clustering and anomaly detection.
* Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
* Build a deep reinforcement learning model.

## Table of Contents
The Specialization includes thre courses:
* Course one: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification.
* Course ttwo: Advanced Learning Algorithms.
* Course three: Unsupervised Learning: Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning.
